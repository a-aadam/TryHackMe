# TryHackMe
This repository contains resources about THM paths and rooms. It focuses mainly on answers and extremly summerized versions of THM's contents.
This repository on its own will not help you learn anything. It is aimed at helping you recall the contents of paths and help you through rooms.
<br><br>It will be updated as I progress through the paths.
<br>If you would like to contribute to this repo, feel free to DM on my LinkedIn.
